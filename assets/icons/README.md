# Product icons

These 256 px transparent PNGs are used as Discord thumbnails and Microsoft
Teams header images. They are locally hosted with the other Nowlert assets,
so card rendering does not depend on a vendor CDN at delivery time.

Every product-specific image below is derived from an official vendor page or
official source repository. Conversion is limited to rasterization, scaling,
transparent-background cleanup, and centering in a square canvas. Light or
reverse vendor variants are used where needed for Teams' dark card surface.
