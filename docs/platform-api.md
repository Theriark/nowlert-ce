# v2 authenticated platform API

Phase 4 exposes the local-account, ownership, routing, output, history, and
audit foundations through the `/api/v2` JSON API. It also provides the
user/application event-ingestion path used by platform routes. Phase 5 adds a
same-origin browser client for this contract; see the [WebUI guide](webui.md).

v2.3.2 exposes credential-free mounted YAML metadata, administrator-only
atomic mutations, notice lifecycle controls, backup destinations, and audited
restart. The browser never receives destination, application-token, or remote
share credential material.

## Default and activation boundary

The HTTP transport, API, and platform are enabled when their switches are
omitted. An operator can still disable any layer explicitly:

```yaml
http:
  enabled: true
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8080

api:
  enabled: true

platform:
  enabled: true
  state_dir: "/nowlert/state"
  configuration_model: "platform_database_v1"
  secure_cookies: false
```

On an empty database, `GET /api/v2/bootstrap` reports that setup is required.
The image prints a short-lived, single-use setup token to container output;
`POST /api/v2/bootstrap` consumes it while creating the first administrator
and browser session. The `false` value permits direct HTTP login only on a
trusted private network because a browser sends the session cookie without
transport encryption. Use `secure_cookies: true`, `webui.enforce_https: true`,
and a TLS reverse proxy for untrusted or Internet-facing access.

Do not expose port 8080 directly to the Internet. Terminate TLS at a trusted
reverse proxy, apply firewall restrictions, preserve the original client
address, and do not cache `/api/v2` responses.

## Authentication boundary

Browser and management operations use a local session:

- `POST /api/v2/session` accepts a username and password;
- the server returns an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` session cookie;
- secure deployments use `__Host-` cookie names and the `Secure` attribute;
- the one-time CSRF value is returned in the login response and a readable,
  same-site CSRF cookie; and
- every session-authenticated `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` request must
  send the value as `X-CSRF-Token`.

Sessions have absolute and idle expiry. Logout, password reset, and account
disable revoke them. Login attempts retain the persistent lockout rules and
also have a per-client in-memory rate limit. Authenticated session requests
have a separate per-session/per-client rate limit.

Platform API tokens are accepted only by `POST /api/v2/events`. They cannot be
used for account, token, destination, route, preview, history, or audit
management. Tokens are source-scoped, rate-limited per token and client,
returned only at creation or rotation, and stored only as SHA-256 digests.

Legacy YAML application tokens are imported into SQLite during the v2.5 migration.
Their existing values continue working, but token management is database-only
after migration.

An administrator may create a resource for another owner by including
`owner_user_id`. A regular user cannot select another owner. Only an
administrator can create or change a shared destination, create wildcard
tokens/routes, create administrator tokens, or allow private-network output
delivery.

## Session example

Login saves both cookies and returns the CSRF value:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body \
  --cookie-jar /tmp/nowlert.cookies \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"username":"administrator","password":"REPLACE_ME"}' \
  https://nowlert.example.com/api/v2/session
```

Send the returned `csrf_token` on every state-changing session request:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body \
  --cookie /tmp/nowlert.cookies \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-CSRF-Token: RETURNED_LOGIN_VALUE' \
  --data '{
    "name":"Home lab application",
    "source_scopes":["home_lab"],
    "rate_limit_per_minute":60
  }' \
  https://nowlert.example.com/api/v2/tokens
```

The `value` field appears only in this response or a successful rotation.
Store it immediately in the submitting application. It cannot be retrieved
later.

## Destination secret example

Public settings and credentials are deliberately separate in the request:

```json
{
  "name": "Operations webhook",
  "output_type": "webhook",
  "settings": {
    "method": "POST",
    "timeout_seconds": 15,
    "sign_hmac": true
  },
  "secret": {
    "url": "https://receiver.example.com/nowlert",
    "hmac_secret": "REPLACE_ME"
  }
}
```

The response contains `secret_configured: true`; it never contains the secret,
secret-file path, stored digest, webhook URL, password, or token. Updating the
`secret` field rotates the owner-only secret. A user may route to or test a
shared destination but cannot read or replace its owner's credentials.

## Event submission

Applications submit the stable event envelope with a platform token:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer PLATFORM_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "schema":"nowlert.event.v1",
    "source":"home_lab",
    "title":"Synthetic warning",
    "message":"A bounded application event.",
    "severity":"warning",
    "status":"active"
  }' \
  https://nowlert.example.com/api/v2/events
```

The token must include `home_lab`. The service evaluates only the token owner's
enabled platform routes and internally resolves secrets as each destination's
true owner. The response reports matched routes, successful/failed deliveries,
and total attempts; it never includes response bodies or destination secrets.

## Safe responses and compatibility

All `/api/v2` responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`,
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`. Error
messages are intentionally generic. Preview and test responses use bounded
backend formatters and safe transport results. Delivery history and audit
events are owner-filtered; administrators may inspect all retained records.

The mounted file is authoritative. The legacy v1.x upload endpoints remain for
API compatibility; successful imports are adopted into YAML automatically.
